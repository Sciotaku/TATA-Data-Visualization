# TATA-Data-Visualization

This project is part of the Tata Data Visualisation: Empowering Business with Effective Insights.

I comprehensively analyzed TATA's online retail store data in this project to provide valuable insights to the CEO and CMO. This project aims to evaluate business performance, identify the key factors driving revenue, and suggest strategic metrics for decision-making, including expansion plans. I examined operational and marketing perspectives, considering revenue trends, profitability by product category, customer demographics, marketing effectiveness, and customer behavior. By addressing the CEO's focus on revenue generation and the CMO's emphasis on customer engagement, this analysis aims to empower data-driven decision-making for Tata's future growth and success.

Furthermore, I focused on analyzing and visualizing sales data to uncover lucrative business opportunities for expansion. Through thorough data cleanup and effective visualization techniques, I discovered valuable insights such as seasonal growth patterns, high-potential markets, customer purchasing behavior, and regional revenue distribution. These findings guided my strategic decision-making, allowing me to capitalize on growth opportunities, tailor strategies for different markets, and diversify our customer base for sustainable revenue growth. This project emphasizes the importance of data-driven analysis in driving business expansion and provides a solid foundation for future strategic planning.
